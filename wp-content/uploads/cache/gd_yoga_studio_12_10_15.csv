<p align=""justify"">Keith Fox developed YogaFox Vinyasa based on his years of study in the Ashtanga and Vinyasa “limb” of the Family Tree of Hatha Yoga.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Keith is well known in South Florida for his Yoga with Live Music class which welcomes over 100 students each Sunday from 9:30-11am at The Colony Hotel in Delray Beach, Florida. Keith also shares his Yoga with Live Music at local Workshops, Retreats, and at National Festivals such as Wanderlust and YogaFest. His classes always includes the classic YogaFox Vinyasa Flow as well as an amazing Yoga Nidra Meditation to close the class. Keith plays harmonium and shares his devotion at each class as well.</p>
<p align=""justify"">What exactly is YogaFox? The system developed by Keith Fox incorporates many asanas from the first, second, and third series of Ashtanga Yoga (as shared by Pattabi Jois) as well as a variety of other asanas. Keith’s partner, Kelly Brookbank Fox, brings experience from the Kripalu school of yoga which enables the YogaFox Vinyasa school to incorporate advanced pranayama and meditation in motion into the flow. Further, Keith and Kelly both share their love of Kali Natha Yoga (as taught by Guru Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati) in their teachings. This combination of the physical asana along with the meditative practices of yoga allows the YogaFox Studios and school to offer a comprehensive yoga experience for all participants. Keith also incorporates Bhakti Yoga and Nada Yoga (devotion and healing sound qualities) with his sharing of music at all of his classes through singing and kirtan.</p>
<p align=""justify"">YogaFox studios has two studios in Delray Beach Florida and offers 38+ classes per week. Most instructors are trained by YogaFox school of Yoga and share components of the training described above.</p>

2512,"Yogi Hari's Ashram",1,"Shri Yogi Hari is a master of Sampoorna Yoga (Yoga of Fulness). He is well known and respected around the world as an exeptionally inspiring teacher and Guru. His presence alone is transforming. At the age of 22 he was labeled as a medicated incurable. By the grace of God he was introduced to Yoga and he knew right away that this was what he should be living and practicing in his life. For eight years he practiced with intense dedication and in that time he transformed his whole body into a state of perfect health. Shri Yogi Hari is like an ocean that can never have enough of this divine science and he longed to meet his Guru. In 1975 he had the blessing of meeting his Gurus Swami Vishnudevananda and Swami Nadabrahmananda and at that time he retired from the wordly life and spent 7 years in the Sivananda, Ashram where he immeresed himself fully in yoga sadhana. That was a time of great transformation on all levels. Yogi Hari studied the science of Nada Yoga for 14 years from the great master Swami Nadabrahmananda. He has since then continued to immerse himself in the practice of Nada Yoga and created many inspiring and uplifting CDs and instructional books and DVDs on the science of Nada Yoga. Sampoorna Yoga is the fruit of Yogi Hariâs tireless striving for perfection in his practice and teaching. It is the yoga of fullness that intelligently integrates Hatha, Raja Karma Bhakti Jnana and Nada Yoga to purify and harmonize all aspects of the human personality so that the light of the soul shines forth in its divine splendour. His approach is deep simple and practical and helps people from every background to live a richer and happier life based on lasting yogic values. The basic teaching is that health peace and joy are already within you. They are your birthright. Sampoorna Yoga can help you to uncover them. Shri Yogi Hari is the author of 4 books and has recorded over 36 CDâs. Regular classes seminars sadhana weeks yoga teacher certification courses and satsangs are given by Shri Yogi Hari at his Ashram in Miramar Florida.","Alignment,Children's,Core Strength,Family,Flow,Gentle,Hatha,Integral Kundalini,Meditation,Restorative,Senior,Sivananda",,gd_yoga_studio,publish,,6,Never,,"12750 SW 33rd St",Miramar,FL,"United States",33027,25.979,-80.3113038095238,,,,,,,,,,2015-01-01,,,,,,
