<h3>History</h3>
Established in 2015.

A three-week trip to Italy almost 15 years ago sparked the Shipleys' love affair with gelato. Papalani Gelato® Franchising Company is a family-owned and operated franchisor of handmade Hawaiian style gelato, coffee, and chocolate shops which is dedicated to sharing its hand-crafted artisanal Hawaiian inspired gelato, coffees, and chocolates throughout the state of Hawaii and beyond.

In May 2015 Mark Rubenstein became the first franchisor on the east coast of South Florida. Customers love the Papalani™ product and while gelato is still a new product in the US market, once tried, most consumers prefer it to ice cream or other more traditional frozen desserts. Many customers rave that Papalani™ has the best gelato (Italian style ice cream) and best chocolate in the nation. Mark, Chief Smile Officer, welcomes you to visit and enjoy Hawaiian Gelato, Coffee, Chocolates and Desserts.","Coffee Tea Shop,Food / Beverage","Coffee &amp; Tea,Gelato,Ice,Papalani Gelato",gd_consciousbusiness,publish,,3,Never,,"16950 Jog Rd","Delray Beach",Florida,"United States",33446,26.474819,-80.14645100000001,"7:00 am - 10:00 pm",+1-561-536-5866,,http://www.yelp.com/biz/papalani-gelato-delray-beach,,,,,"<h3>Meet the Business Owner</h3>

Mark has been managing and developing people and business since growing up in the retail business. Since Gelato and Chocolate are the top two of his version of the 5 food groups (cheese, bread and wine complete the groups) it was natural that he was attracted to the unique, high quality and personal service of the Papalani Gelato Brand.
His mission to create Joy and develop people so they get they make a difference in the world made this business a perfect fit. He is dedicated to creating a unique customer experience that re-defines the traditional, frozen treat, coffee and dessert experience.
